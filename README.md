# DHGLMs

This repository contains all files and code required to implement Double-Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (DHGLMs) for analyzing isotopic data with hierarchical structures.

The analyses and figures included here correspond to the manuscript:
“A new approach to quantify isotopic (co)variation across levels of biological organization using double-hierarchical generalized linear models” (Garrido-de León et al.)

All materials are organized into three biological levels, each representing a level of hierarchical organization:
individual, population, and community.

For each level, we provide detailed workflows to obtain:

Repeatability indices, Correlation parameters for model variance components, and Posterior estimates of residual intra-individual variation for carbon and nitrogen isotopes.

Note that these three outputs—(i), (ii), and (iii)—were estimated for each biological level.
